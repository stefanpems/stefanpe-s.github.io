Hi there! My name is Stefano Pescosolido, I'm a Microsoft employee, leaving and working in Italy. 
I'm passionate of  modern Information Technology, especially related to cloud services and security.
My current role is Technical Specialist in IT Security, so I'm very focused in understanding, experimenting and presenting new technologies.
I created this simple blog site as a kind of personal notebook with public access. I hope that some content may be relevant to others. Happy to share! 
Everything that is written here is my personal opinion and may differ from my employer's view.
