"Defender for Containers" is the plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud protecting Kubernetes clusters running on premises or in the cloud. 

This video shows the components of the solution in a laboratory environment with an AKS cluster in Microsoft Azure, an EKS cluster in Amazon AWS, a GKE cluster in Google GCP and a CNCF-compliant standard K8s cluster created on Virtual Machines. 

The demo shows the detection capabilities of Defender for Container in the areas of security configurations, image vulnerabilities (both in registry and running images) and potentially harmful situations deliberately generated on the monitored clusters via attack simulations based on the [Kubernetes Goat](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/) workloads.
