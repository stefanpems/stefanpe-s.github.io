All customers data in Azure is [encrypted "at rest"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-atrest) on the Microsoft datacenters. By default, the keys used in the cryptographic operations are totally managed by Microsoft throughout their entire lifecycle: they are defined as ["Microsoft Managed Keys" (MMKs) (sometimes also referred as "Platform Managed Keys" or "Service Managed Keys")](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/key-management). A wide majority of Azure PaaS and IaaS services storing customers' data allows to encrypt this data by using a ["Customer Managed Key" (CMK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-models#supporting-services), generated by the customer (possibly in an on premises HSM), updated by the customer, and securely transferred in Azure Key Vault (AKV) or, when supported, in an Azure Managed HSM (M-HSM) module. Each of these PaaS/IaaS services has its own procedures and constraints for moving from MMK to CMK.
